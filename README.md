One Sensor

For one sensor, the code is quite simple. Since ADC10MEM only has to be one value, the temperature function only needs to be called once.
The sensor is set to get multiple readings from the sensor. 

Two Sensors

With two sensors, it follows the same concept with one extra step. Since the MSP430 only has one space for internal memory, the value has to store
and the memory value hgas to reset to zero.
